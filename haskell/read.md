to run: 
    1 - in terminal(and inside the project folder), type "ghci". This command will open the haskell compiler
    2 - to compile a program, type ":l <name of code>
    3 - now, you can run your program. For example: you have a code named "soma.hs" that has a sum function with 2 parameters. So, after compilation, to run this example, simply type "soma <first param> <second param>", or, "soma 1 2", by example.
